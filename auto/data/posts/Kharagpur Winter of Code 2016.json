    "html_content": "<p> <span style='display:block; float:left; font-size: 200%;  color:#ffffff; margin-top:5px; margin-right:8px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; text-align:center; background-color: #000;'>D</span>ecember 2016 at Chennai , TamilNadu was pretty much as grim as the previous December, with tragic death of Cheif Minister <a>, followed by <a> that devastated more than 30,000 trees and electricity. Amidst all these happening in background, <a> was probably the only optimistic thing happening around. Kharagpur Winter of Code is a one-month long open-source contribution fest organised by <a>. As a mentor of 7 projects, it felt great to guide newbies in contributing to the projects. I have penned down below - my experiences and proceedings in different projects that happened during KWoC 2016. </p><br><div class='ui horizontal divider'>PROJECT #1 - TV SERIES'</div> <img class='ui big centered image'><p> TV Series ( <a> | <a> ) is an aggregator of Episode Synopsis' and ratings of different TV Series' spread across multiple Wiki sources and IMDb rating. This involves Web Scraping, and writing the scraped data into HTML files - to showcase the episodes with a neat user interface. </p><h4><ul class='ui list'><li> <a> added Sherlock & Firefly series' with 2 Pull requests.</li><li><a> added Person of Interest, Gotham and White Collar series' with 3 Pull Requests.</li><li><a> added Travis Continous Integration support with 1 Pull Request.</li></ul></h4><br><div class='ui horizontal divider'>PROJECT #2 - NAARAD</div> <img class='ui big centered image'><p> Naarad ( <a> | <a> ) is a news aggregator localized to the students of IIT Kharagpur. That is, Naarad scrapes IIT Kharagpur related posts from various IIT Kharagpur groups on facebook, to show them all at one place. </p><h4><ul class='ui list'><li> <a> fixed 2 issues with 2 Pull requests.</li><li> <a> added Travis Continous Integration with 1 Pull Request.</li><li> <a> added fixed an issue with 1 Pull Request.</li></ul></h4><br><div class='ui horizontal divider'>PROJECT #3 - FACULTY SCRAPER</div> <p> The project name is quite self-explanatory - This project aims to keep building a database of faculties of various Institutes across the world. Have a look <a> to the resources aggregated so far.</p><h4><ul class='ui list'><li><a> added support for Princeton faculty, Yale's CS faculty and UCSB faculty with 3 Pull Requests. </li><li><a> added support for CS faculty of UIUC with 1 Pull Request.</li></ul></h4><br><div class='ui horizontal divider'>PROJECT #4 - RUBY NOTIFICATOR </div> <img class='ui big centered image'><p> <a> is a project that aims to keep collecting and aggregating the user's social media data (from Facebook, GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) via APIs, and mail the user regularly (say, everyday) about new notifications from various platforms. This project is pretty much in the early stage. </p><h4><ul class='ui list'><li><a> added support for mailing the notifications of GitHub, with 1 Pull Request. </li></ul></h4><br><div class='ui horizontal divider'>PROJECT #5 - GYFT</div> <img class='ui big centered image'><p> <a> is a gift to the students of IIT Kharagpur, who would like to keep their Timetable from their ERP account synced with their Google Calender. However, contributions are yet to be reviewed and hence, no Pull Request has been merged so far.</p><div class='ui horizontal divider'>CONCLUSION</div><p> A huge token of thanks to Kharagpur Open Source Society for providing this kind of an opportunity to mentor in open source projects. For the experiences from the other side of the grass, have a look at the blog posts written by student members who worked in my projects. <br> <a> <br> <a></p>",
