This year, SciRuby ( <a> | <a> ) has selected 3 students - <a>, <a> and myself. As Shekhar & myself were selected for the same project idea, we had to split the project idea into 2 components and re-draft our timeline schedules. <br><br> A consensus was reached that the project will be split into two parts namely daru-io and daru-views, with the former being done by me and the latter being done by Shekhar. </p><br><div class='ui horizontal divider'>Video Conference #1</div><h4><ul class='ui list'><li><span style='font-weight:100;'> Attendees : Shekhar & Myself</span></li><li><span style='font-weight:100;'> Date : 8th May 2017</span></li><li><span style='font-weight:100;'> Time : 4:15PM - 5:15PM IST </span></li></ul></h4> <p>Through this one hour long discussion, we shared the main highlights of each other's proposals that help with my daru-io part as well as Shakhar's daru-views part. We also had a discussion regarding which libraries could be used for various use cases, and whether we could integrate daru-io and daru-views through a use-case like a 'Download' option in Ruby web frameworks like Rails. </p><br><div class='ui horizontal divider'>Video Conference #2</div><h4><ul class='ui list'><li><span style='font-weight:100;'> Attendees : Shekhar & Myself</span></li><li><span style='font-weight:100;'> Date : 12th May 2017</span></li><li><span style='font-weight:100;'> Time : 4:30PM - 5:50PM IST </span></li></ul></h4> <p>This discussion was essentially a continuation of the previous video conference. We discussed more regarding adding more features in the same timeline, now that our work has been split well. The consensus was to add more support to both daru-io and daru-views. That is, more Import-Export modules will be added to daru-io during the colloborated timeline, while more plotting library support will be added to daru-views. </p><br><div class='ui horizontal divider'>Video Conference #3</div><h4><ul class='ui list'><li><span style='font-weight:100;'> Attendees : <a>, <a>, Shekhar & Myself</span></li><li><span style='font-weight:100;'> Date : 24th May 2017</span></li><li><span style='font-weight:100;'> Time : 7:10PM - 8:40PM IST </span></li></ul></h4> <p> Through this video conference, we discussed about both our re-drafted proposals with mentors Sameer and Victor. By running through our proposal week by week and module by module, we made sure that our timelines have been re-drafted feasibly, and without any clashes.</p><br><div class='ui horizontal divider'>GSoC Meetup at Chennai</div><h4><ul class='ui list'><li><span style='font-weight:100;'> Attendees (from left) : Afroz, Myself, Keerthana, Vignesh, Nishanth</span></li><li><span style='font-weight:100;'> Date : 27th May 2017</span></li><li><span style='font-weight:100;'> Time : 5:20PM - 7:00PM IST </span></li><li><span style='font-weight:100;'> Venue : Phoenix Mall, Velachery</span></li></ul></h4> <img class='ui medium centered image'><p> This was an offline meetup that took place between GSoCers from Chennai, to discuss about their projects, coding, colleges, TV series and what not!
